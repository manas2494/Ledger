#This is a side project which I made as a freelancing assignment. In this web app the admin in the user and he adds vendors along with that he can add bills for each vendors. He can also see the cumulative bill for the vendors. For example if a vendor has a bill of 2000$ dollars for one order and 1000$ dollars for another you'll be able to see a cumulative bill and how much that vendor owes to X person. Ajax, php, html, css and bootstrap are used over here.
